My hobby operating system

After taking 15410 OSDI at CMU, I feel enthusiastic learning more about operating system. I expect to implement an OS from scratch even with a bootloader, file system, networking support, etc. It turned out I'm too streched out with other stuffs and coursework, I haven't had time to work on this yet... but my enthusiasm is still on fire.
